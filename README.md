# General Relativity calculator
Calculator script I wrote and used for a general relativity maths module at university (more for checking my problem sheets and quiz answers _after_ they've been completed... so it might not be error-free _yet_!)

I'm working on writing more tests for it to see if it's 100% reliable and find out what its limits are.

It finds the following for a given metric tensor:
* Metric tensor + inverse + Jacobian (prints them out and makes them look pretty!)
* Christoffel symbols
* Riemann tensor
* Ricci tensor
* Ricci scalar
* Einstein tensor
